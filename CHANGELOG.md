# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Hocus Pocus** extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2020-05-29

### Changed

- "Create Function" will use the generic type instead of the type literal. The generic is more useful and probably what you'd expect.

```ts
doSomething("hello");

// Used to create üòê
function doSomething(param1: "hello") {}

// Now creates üòÉ
function doSomething(param1: string) {}
```

### Fixed

- "Create Variable" created a mess when used in some patterns (if, while, for statements). It now works as expected.
- "Create Function" now infers enum types correctly in TS.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-05-21

### Added

- "Create Function" now adds the inferred types when used from TypeScript files

## [1.3.0] - 2020-05-16

### Added

- **(New Feature)** Create Class

## [1.2.1] - 2020-04-04

### Fixed

- "Create Variable" now works well from variable declarations & JSX syntax

## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-04 - I handle async functions üîÆ

### Added

- "Create Function" now adds `async` keyword if used with `await`, thanks to @automatensalat

So this code:

```js
const result = await doSomething();
```

Will generate:

```js
async function doSomething() {}
```

## [1.1.0] - 2019-12-22 - I can create variables üîÆ

### Added

- **(New Feature)** Create Variable

## [1.0.0] - 2019-12-16 - I can create functions üîÆ

### Added

- **(New Feature)** Create Function
